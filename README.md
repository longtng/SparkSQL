# SparkSQL
The laboratory from CLOUDS Course at EURECOM

This repository included the Stochastic Gradient Descent laboratory from CLOUDS Course at EURECOM, which was conducted in a group with three other members as NGUYEN Van Tuan (Van-Tuan.Nguyen@eurecom.fr) and Yangxin YUAN (Yangxin.Yuan@eurecom.fr)

Furthermore, the CLOUDS - Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing course was offered by Prof. Pietro Michiardi at EURECOM. The details of the course can be retrieved in here http://michiard.github.io/DISC-CLOUD-COURSE/

### Course Description
The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive view of recent topics and trends in distributed systems and cloud computing. We will discuss the software techniques employed to construct and program reliable, highly-scalable systems. We will also cover the architecture design of modern datacenters that constitute a central topic of the cloud computing paradigm. The course is complemented by some lab sessions to get hands-on experience with Apache Spark.

### The Laboratory Description
In this notebook, we will learn how to use the DataFrame API and SparkSQL to perform simple data analytics tasks.

The main goals of this notebook are the following:

- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using DataFrame over RDD
- Analyze the airline data with the DataFrame API and SparkSQL
